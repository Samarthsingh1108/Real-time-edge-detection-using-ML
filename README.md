## Overview

This system uses MLJ5 and OpenCV to implement real-time human pose estimation and edge detection. It captures input from a webcam or video file, detects 17 body keypoints per person, and visualizes skeleton edges in real-time for activity monitoring and movement analysis.


## Introduction

With the rise of AI and computer vision, pose estimation has become critical in understanding human motion and behavior. This project combines MLJ5's powerful keypoint detection with OpenCVâ€™s real-time processing to detect, track, and visualize human posture frame-by-frame. 

The system is fast, lightweight, and suitable for deployment in edge devices like Raspberry Pi or smart cameras. It provides a foundation for real-time activity recognition, health monitoring, and gesture-based applications.
